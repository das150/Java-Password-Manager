# Java Password Manager
This is a password manager application and IB documentation (WILL UPLOAD AFTER M23 IB EXAMS) that I made for my IB Computer Science IA. It helps users store and manage passwords and other sensitive information. I scored a 32/34 (7) from my teacher.

Features include:
- A master password is required to access the main menu; the user can create one if one
does not exist.
- There are limited login attempts with an incorrect master password.
- An account list, retrieved from an XML file and displayed in the main menu, is sorted in
descending order, with the most-used accounts at the top.
- Users can add, remove, and filter/search items from the account list.
- When adding an account, users can generate strong, randomized passwords that meet
standard password complexity requirements.
- Users can select a renewal period for a password when adding an account. The
program will display a message when a password is about to expire.
- The data is secure and encrypted with AES-256 using a password-based encryption
key.
- A password scan feature to identify any weak passwords that are being used.

## Usage

The rockyou.txt file is a placeholder due to file size limitations; you will need to download the original from https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt if you wish to have full functionality.

You can then create a new .jar from the files. Java 17 or later is required, else a runtime error will occur).
