# Java-Password-Manager
A password manager made with Java for my IB Comp Sci SL class. This is my IA.

An example .jar is provided.

To create this project on your own, download the files, open the PasswordManager.java and change the masterPassword to a BCrpyt based on your password (using https://bcrypt-generator.com/)

Additionally, the rockyou.txt file is a placeholder due to file size limitations; you will need to download the original from https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt if you wish to use it.

More info coming soon.
