# Java Password Manager
This is a password manager application and IB documentation (WILL UPLOAD AFTER M23 IB EXAMS) that I made for my IB Computer Science IA. It helps users store and manage passwords and other sensitive information. I scored a 32/34 (7) from my teacher.

## Usage

The rockyou.txt file is a placeholder due to file size limitations; you will need to download the original from https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt if you wish to have full functionality.

You can then create a new .jar from the files. Java 17 or later is required, else a runtime error will occur).
