# Java Password Manager
This is a password manager that I made with Java for my IB Computer Science IA.

The rockyou.txt file is a placeholder due to file size limitations; you will need to download the original from https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt if you wish to have full functionality.

You can then create a new .jar from the files (requires class file version 61.0 to run (Java 17) - else a runtime error will occur).

More info coming soon.
